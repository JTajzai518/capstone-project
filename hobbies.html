<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<p>My list of hobbies aren't very extensive but there are a few thing I do enjoy doing and also hope of doing as hobbies in the future.</p>

<h3>Gaming:</h3>

<p>This is by far my most favorite hobby. Many people frown upon gamers, but personally I feel like gaming is better than watching TV or scrolling through your phone all day. If you think about it, you're socializing with others and also using your brain to predict opponent strategies or making your own strategies. Some games also require you to have fast hand to eye coordination. I personally love the game for not only the social aspect, but also because I enjoy competition.</p>

<h3>Cooking:</h3>

<p>Cooking wasn't always a hobby, but as I grew up and tried newer dishes and saw how good they were I wanted to replicate them. That's when I started cooking. I slowly started trying newer recipes and even started baking. I enjoy making food for others to try because I like making others happy through their stomach, especially my wife.</p>

<h3>Coding:</h3>

<p>Can't say this is my favorite hobby, but I've grown to like it. I've realized that I shy away from difficult task, but it doesn't make sense because as a person I love challenges and competition. I've tried to get over that fear and I'm hoping that this time around I will be more patient with myself and not be upset or frustrated when things don't go the way I want them too. I really want to become a developer. I will become a developer.</p>
